Hello!

The goal of the exercise is to learn how to read adding and removing elements from objects created in arrays.
It is intended to be a simple to-do-list application. In this project, as in the previous one, I do not focus on the visual part of the task, it is to teach practical JS.

Cheers Tymek (¬‿¬)
